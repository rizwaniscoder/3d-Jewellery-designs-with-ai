# Automated Jewellery 3D Model Generator


This Streamlit application enables users to generate 3D models of jewellery designs automatically. It utilizes OpenAI's language models for generating image prompts and DALL路E 3 for image generation. Additionally, it integrates with the CSM API for 3D model generation.

## Features

- **Jewellery Image Prompt Generation**: Generate prompts for jewellery design images.
- **DALL路E 3 Image Generation**: Generate jewellery design images using DALL路E 3 based on the provided prompts.
- **3D Model Generation with CSM**: Generate 3D models of jewellery designs using the CSM API.
- **Customization**: Customize prompts for image generation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine
- Streamlit library
- OpenAI API key
- CSM API key (for 3D model generation)
